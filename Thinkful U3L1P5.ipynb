    "No single measure of central tendency is enough to evaluate a data set. Using just the mean has problems in that a data set can have high variance in which the mean describes next to nothing. Using just the median has similar issues with less accuracy. Using just the mode is perhaps the least informing measure, in that you can have sets that are multi-modal or have no mode.\n",
